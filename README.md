# Mandelbrot

Plots a fractal (currently supports the Mandelbrot set and Burning Ship fractal). Plan to add support for Julia sets.

Currently there is a glitch where the image is flipped over the x-axis; this is irrelevant for now, since the Mandelbrot set is
symmetric over the x-axis and the Burning ship fractal is usually presented reflected over the x-axis.
